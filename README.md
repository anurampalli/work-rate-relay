# Work Rate Relay

Work Rate Relay is a ServiceNow scoped application designed to streamline employee performance reviews by automating data entry, notification delivery, and reporting. Built using ServiceNow Studio and Git source control, this project showcases practical application development across custom tables, workflows, email notifications, and real-time analytics.

This app was developed as part of a training project to demonstrate end-to-end capabilities in ServiceNow development — including table design, email triggers, report configuration, and scoped app packaging.

## Table Structures

🧑‍💼 Employee Table
- Employee ID (auto-generated)
- Employee Name (Reference: sys_user)
- Work Done in FY24 (HTML)

👨‍💼 Manager Table
- Manager Name (Reference: sys_user)
- Employee Name (Reference: sys_user)
- Performance Review (HTML)
- Rating (Choice: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Bad)

---

## Email Notification Logic

- When an employee creates a new record, the system:
  - Sends an email to the assigned manager
  - Includes all "Work Done in FY24" details

- When a manager updates the rating field:
  - The system sends an email to the employee
  - Includes the rating and performance review text

Emails are triggered using standard Notification Rules configured via Conditions and Template Variables.

---

## Report Generation

- Pie Chart report categorizes employee performance by rating level:
  - Excellent: 2 employees
  - Very Good: 5 employees
  - Good: N employees
  - Bad: N employees

- Accessible via Reporting → Create New → Chart → Table: Manager

---

## Update Set Strategy

- The application changes are stored in an Update Set called:
  sys_remote_update_set_011924eec36a2e1049ccbd0ed40131a6.xml

- This allows easy export/import into other instances if needed.
