1. Employee table has "Employee Id" field which is auto-generated. but when the same employee creates a new record in the table with a different work done, there will be multiple employee Ids for a single employee - solution in my opinion is to keep this auto-generated field as "work record id" instead of employee id for better clarity
2. If employee name in the "Manager Table" refers to the employee table instead of the user table, a notification will not be triggered to employee when a manger inserts a performance review record or updates a performance review record in the manager table - solution in my opinion is to reference the employee name from "sys_user" table instead of the new employee table
